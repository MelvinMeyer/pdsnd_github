### Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will explore the data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City and Washington. With the project workspace provided by udacity or with python, I will write a code to import data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will write a script that inputs raw data to give an interavtive experience in the terminal to present these stastics.

# Software needed to complete Project:
The following software was used to complete Project 2:

•	Python or Udacity Workspace

•	A text editor: Atom

•	A terminal Application: Git Bash

### Files used
• chicago.csv

• new_york_city.csv

• washington.csv

# The Datasets
The data is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for major cities in United States. In this Project, I will use the data to compare the system usage between three large cities: Cities, New York City and Washington. Random data for all three cities are provided for the first six months of 2017. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:

• Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)

• End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)

• Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)

• Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)

• End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)

• User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

Chicago and New York City also contain the following columns:

• Gender

• Birth year 

### Credits
• Lessons provided by udacity in the Introduction to Data Science with Python helped build my knowledge to complete the project.
